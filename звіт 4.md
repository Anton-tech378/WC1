**Словник базових термінів**

Process – A running instance of a program on the system.

PID (Process ID) – A unique identifier assigned to each running process.

PPID (Parent Process ID) – The process ID of the parent process that started another process.

TTY (Terminal Type) – The terminal device associated with a process.

UID (User ID) – The identifier of the user who owns the process.

GID (Group ID) – The identifier of the group associated with a process.

CPU Time – The amount of processor time a process has consumed.

Virtual Memory (VIRT) – The total amount of memory allocated to a process.

Resident Memory (RES) – The physical memory a process is currently using.

Shared Memory (SHR) – The memory a process shares with other processes.

Process State – The current status of a process:

R (Running) – The process is actively using the CPU.

S (Sleeping) – The process is waiting for an event.

D (Disk Sleep) – The process is waiting for I/O operations.

T (Stopped/Traced) – The process has been suspended.

Z (Zombie) – The process has finished but its parent hasn't acknowledged its termination.

Priority (PRI) – A value that determines the process scheduling order.

Nice Value (NI) – A user-defined priority modifier that affects process scheduling.

Load Average – A measure of system activity over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

Swapping – The process of moving inactive memory pages from RAM to disk.

ps Command – A command used to view currently running processes.

top Command – A real-time monitoring tool for system processes and resource usage.

kill Command – A command to terminate a process using its PID.

killall Command – A command to terminate all processes by name.

Signal – A message sent to a process to control its execution, such as:

HUP (1) – Hangs up the process.

INT (2) – Interrupts the process (Ctrl+C equivalent).

QUIT (3) – Stops execution.

KILL (9) – Forces termination.

TERM (15) – Gracefully terminates.

STOP (17) – Suspends the process without terminating.

CONT (19) – Resumes a suspended process.

**Контрольні питання(Зверєв Міхаіл)**


1. The /proc directory in Linux systems serves as a virtual filesystem that provides information about running processes and system resources. It contains details such as CPU usage, memory statistics, process information, and kernel parameters, making it essential for system monitoring and debugging.

2. To dynamically determine which of any three processes is using the most memory at a given moment, commands like ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 4 or top can be used. The memory consumption percentage of the highest memory-using process can be calculated by dividing its memory usage by the total available RAM.

3. To retrieve the hierarchy of parent processes in Linux, the pstree command provides a structured tree view, while ps -ef --forest displays a similar hierarchical structure. This hierarchy consists of the init/systemd process at the top, with child and descendant processes branching out.

4. The top command provides a real-time dynamic view of system processes, displaying CPU and memory usage, while ps captures a static snapshot of processes at a specific moment.

5. Compared to top, htop offers additional features such as a more interactive and user-friendly interface, color-coded resource usage, vertical and horizontal scrolling, and the ability to kill processes directly from the interface.

6. The components of a mobile OS responsible for monitoring running processes include the task manager, system monitor, and kernel-based process scheduler. These components manage and display process activity, CPU, and memory usage.

7. Most mobile operating systems support terminal-based process management. On Android, tools like Termux or built-in adb shell allow users to monitor and control processes using commands like ps, top, and kill.

8. Third-party applications for managing and monitoring processes on mobile devices include SystemPanel, Simple System Monitor, and Task Manager. These tools offer features like real-time CPU and memory usage tracking, process termination, and system performance analytics.
